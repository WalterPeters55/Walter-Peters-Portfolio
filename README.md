# Walter-Peters-Portfolio

For this challenge, we were asked to create a professional portfolio that will be used to showcase our work to potential employers in the future. This site was created using HTML and CSS

## HTML
 - HTML was used to create the structure of the webpage. This includes the content, information, and images displayed on the page. 
 - The Webpage includes a navigation bar at the top to help the user find the information they are looking for. The site also includes a recent image of myself as well as three sections including an about, projects, and contact section. 

## CSS
 - CSS was used to style the webpage including the color, font, placement, and more. 
 - A media query was used to make the webpage interactive.
